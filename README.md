# This is a very simple JavaScript application

This simple application is written using vanilla JavaScript:

- It serves as an exercise in event handling.
- No attention is given to styling with CSS.
- There is no persistent data storage.
  -There is no use of local storage.

## Notes About Persistent Data and Real-World Application

- In the real world we would need to store data in a database.
- Databases don't understand the HTML we've written, they take in raw data.
- Libraries such as React make data handling easier in modern web development.
- The first objective is to understand the fundamentals of web development by working with with vanilla languages and the full stack scope of the application's requirements
- Next up, full stack-environment with Node.js server side scripting and MongoDB.
